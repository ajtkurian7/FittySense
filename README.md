FittySense is a web application inspired by Strava that will be built using Ruby on Rails and React.js.  FittySense will be used to create workouts that implement both running and circuit training throughout different cities.

## Features & Implementation

### React Based Front end

The front-end of this application uses React.js along with Flux to deliver front-end content quickly and efficiently.

### Creation of Routes/workouts

Routes can be created quickly and easily using the Google Maps API.  Markers can be placed on the map where directions, provided by Google, are displayed clearly.  Markers can be assigned an exercise from the Exercise bank to organize the interval training aspect of the workout.


### Create exercises

Exercises can be created and stored in the database for use when creating routes.

### Logging Recently Completed Exercises

The activity feed is updated when a route is completed.  The route is completed by providing the date, start time and end time of the workout.


## Planned Features

### Social integration

A  social networking platform will be built on top of this app with multiple users following each other, sharing workouts, and commenting on activity feeds.

### Dynamic Statistics

Statistics can be calculated with a singular score based on how many workouts completed in a time frame and the number of exercises per workout.  Difficulty of exercises can dynamically change based on other exercises in the route and other workouts completely recently.

### Spotify Playlist Integration

Ability to add your favorite playlist when completing the route.
